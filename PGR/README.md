# Witch Room

An interactive 3D scene using **C++** and the **OpenGL** library as a semester work of a 
course *„Computer graphics programming“* in CTU.

## Description

The 3D scene contains the witch's room. The room is lit by candles that can be blown out and lighted again. On the shelves you will find various ingredients for making elixirs. In the middle of the room is the main pot with the prepared potion. A small phantom flies aimlessly around the room. Unfortunately, you can't get to the second floor via the spiral stairs because the trapdoor is closed.
